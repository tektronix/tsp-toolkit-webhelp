<p class="safetyprocedures">The following safety precautions should be observed before using this product and any associated instrumentation. Although some instruments and accessories would normally be used with nonhazardous voltages, there are situations where hazardous conditions may be present.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">This product is intended for use by personnel who recognize shock hazards and are familiar with the safety precautions required to avoid possible injury. Read and follow all installation, operation, and maintenance information carefully before using the product. Refer to the user documentation for complete product specifications.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">If the product is used in a manner not specified, the protection provided by the product warranty may be impaired.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">The types of product users are:</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures"><strong class="specialbold">Responsible body</strong> is the individual or group responsible for the use and maintenance of equipment, for ensuring that the equipment is operated within its specifications and operating limits, and for ensuring that operators are adequately trained.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures"><strong class="specialbold">Operators</strong> use the product for its intended function. They must be trained in electrical safety procedures and proper use of the instrument. They must be protected from electric shock and contact with hazardous live circuits.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures"><strong class="specialbold">Maintenance personnel</strong> perform routine procedures on the product to keep it operating properly, for example, setting the line voltage or replacing consumable materials. Maintenance procedures are described in the user documentation. The procedures explicitly state if the operator may perform them. Otherwise, they should be performed only by service personnel.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures"><strong class="specialbold">Service personnel</strong> are trained to work on live circuits, perform safe installations, and repair products. Only properly trained service personnel may perform installation and service procedures.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Keithley products are designed for use with electrical signals that are measurement, control, and data I/O connections, with low transient overvoltages, and must not be directly connected to mains voltage or to voltage sources with high transient overvoltages. Measurement Category II (as referenced in IEC 60664) connections require protection for high transient overvoltages often associated with local AC mains connections. Certain Keithley measuring instruments may be connected to mains. These instruments will be marked as category II or higher.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Unless explicitly allowed in the specifications, operating manual, and instrument labels, do not connect any instrument to mains.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Exercise extreme caution when a shock hazard is present. Lethal voltage may be present on cable connector jacks or test fixtures. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) states that a shock hazard exists when voltage levels greater than 30&nbsp;V RMS, 42.4&nbsp;V peak, or 60&nbsp;VDC are present. A good safety practice is to expect that hazardous voltage is present in any unknown circuit before measuring.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Operators of this product must be protected from electric shock at all times. The responsible body must ensure that operators are prevented access and/or insulated from every connection point. In some cases, connections must be exposed to potential human contact. Product operators in these circumstances must be trained to protect themselves from the risk of electric shock. If the circuit is capable of operating at or above 1000&nbsp;V, no conductive part of the circuit may be exposed.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Do not connect switching cards directly to unlimited power circuits. They are intended to be used with impedance-limited sources. NEVER connect switching cards directly to AC mains. When connecting sources to switching cards, install protective devices to limit fault current and voltage to the card.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Before operating an instrument, ensure that the line cord is connected to a properly-grounded power receptacle. Inspect the connecting cables, test leads, and jumpers for possible wear, cracks, or breaks before each use.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">When installing equipment where access to the main power cord is restricted, such as rack mounting, a separate main input power disconnect device must be provided in close proximity to the equipment and within easy reach of the operator.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">For maximum safety, do not touch the product, test cables, or any other instruments while power is applied to the circuit under test. ALWAYS remove power from the entire test system and discharge any capacitors before connecting or disconnecting cables or jumpers, installing or removing switching cards, or making internal changes, such as installing or removing jumpers.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Do not touch any object that could provide a current path to the common side of the circuit under test or power line (earth) ground. Always make measurements with dry hands while standing on a dry, insulated surface capable of withstanding the voltage being measured.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">For safety, instruments and accessories must be used in accordance with the operating instructions. If the instruments or accessories are used in a manner not specified in the operating instructions, the protection provided by the equipment may be impaired.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Do not exceed the maximum signal levels of the instruments and accessories. Maximum signal levels are defined in the specifications and operating information and shown on the instrument panels, test fixture panels, and switching cards.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">When fuses are used in a product, replace with the same type and rating for continued protection against fire hazard.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Chassis connections must only be used as shield connections for measuring circuits, NOT as protective earth (safety ground) connections.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">If you are using a test fixture, keep the lid closed while power is applied to the device under test. Safe operation requires the use of a lid interlock.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">If a <img id="f19511" src="screwicon_lr.png" class="linkedepsandpngtemplatenofigurenumberortitle" alt="Screw icon" height="19" width="19" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"> screw is present, connect it to protective earth (safety ground) using the wire recommended in the user documentation.</p>

Always read the associated information very carefully before performing the indicated procedure. Damage to the instrument may invalidate the warranty. </p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Instrumentation and accessories shall not be connected to humans.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Before performing any maintenance, disconnect the line cord and all test cables.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">To maintain protection from electric shock and fire, replacement components in mains circuits &#8212; including the power transformer, test leads, and input jacks &#8212; must be purchased from Keithley. Standard fuses with applicable national safety approvals may be used if the rating and type are the same. The detachable mains power cord provided with the instrument may only be replaced with a similarly rated power cord. Other components that are not safety-related may be purchased from other suppliers as long as they are equivalent to the original component (note that selected parts should be purchased only through Keithley to maintain accuracy and functionality of the product). If you are unsure about the applicability of a replacement component, call a Keithley office for information.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">Unless otherwise noted in product-specific literature, Keithley instruments are designed to operate indoors only, in the following environment: Altitude at or below 2,000 m (6,562 ft); temperature 0&nbsp;°C to 50&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F to 122&nbsp;°F); and pollution degree 1 or 2.</p>
<p class="safetyprocedures">To clean an instrument, use a cloth dampened with deionized water or mild, water-based cleaner. Clean the exterior of the instrument only. Do not apply cleaner directly to the instrument or allow liquids to enter or spill on the instrument. Products that consist of a circuit board with no case or chassis (e.g., a data acquisition board for installation into a computer) should never require cleaning if handled according to instructions. If the board becomes contaminated and operation is affected, the board should be returned to the factory for proper cleaning/servicing.</p>
