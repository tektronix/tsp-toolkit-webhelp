Depending on the configuration of the integrating ADC, periodic fresh reference measurements are required to minimize drift. The measurement aperture is used to determine the time interval between these measurement updates. For additional information, see Autozero. To help optimize operation of this ADC, the instrument caches the reference and zero values for up to ten of the most recent number of power line cycles. For additional information, see NPLC caching.","The fast ADC can acquire measurements at speeds up to 1 million samples per second. The fast ADC does not take reference measurements.

Sustained high data acquisition rates will cause the display to stop updating. A sustained high data acquisition rate during a sweep or pulse train may slow source operations. This can cause erratic sweep or pulse timing and may lead to triggers being missed (trigger overruns). Use the status model to monitor for trigger overruns.

By default, the instrument automatically checks these reference measurements whenever a signal measurement is made (AUTO). If the reference measurements are out of date when a signal measurement is made, the instrument will automatically take two more A/D conversions, one for the reference and one for the zero, before returning the result. Thus, occasionally, a measurement takes longer than normal.","This extra time can cause problems in sweeps and other test sequences in which measurement timing is critical.
