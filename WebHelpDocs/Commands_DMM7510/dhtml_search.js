The digitize functions can provide 1,000,000 readings per second at 4½ digits. Digitize voltage and digitize current have separate internal signal paths that are optimized for fast response to signal changes.","The sample rate determines how often the readings are output by the digitize function. You can set it from 1000 to 1,000,000 readings per second.","The aperture determines the reading conversion time. This is when data is gathered to create the reading. You set the aperture time in 1&nbsp;µs intervals. If the aperture is more than 1&nbsp;µs, the consecutive 1&nbsp;µs readings are averaged to produce the reading. ","The sample rate affects the available aperture settings. The maximum aperture is determined by 1/sample rate (rounded down to the nearest integer).
