This value can only be changed when the buffer is empty. Use bufferVar.clear() to empty the buffer.  If the append mode is set to 0 (off), any previously stored readings in the buffer are cleared before new ones are stored. If append mode is set to 1, any previously stored readings remain in the buffer and new readings are added to the buffer following the stored readings.  With append mode set to 1 (on), the first new measurement is stored at reading buffer location [n+1], where n is the number of readings stored in the buffer. When the fill mode is set to once, measurements are only appended to a buffer if the measure count is less than the available space in the buffer. If the buffer cannot hold the readings, an error is returned and no measurements are made.

Measurements are in the following units of measure:  v = volts  i = amperes  r = ohms  p = watts  If you use this function without specifying a reading buffer, it makes one measurement and returns that measurement as reading. To use the additional information that is acquired while making a measurement or to return multiple readings, specify a reading buffer. If the instrument is configured to return multiple readings for a measurement and readingBuffer is specified, all readings are available in readingBuffer, but only the last measurement is returned as reading.  The slot[Z].psu[X].measure.iv() function returns the last actual current measurement and voltage measurement as iReading and vReading, respectively. Additionally, it can store current and voltage readings if buffers are provided (iReadingBuffer and vReadingBuffer).  The slot[Z].psu[X].measure.count attribute determines how many measurements are performed. When a reading buffer is used, it also determines the number of readings to store in the buffer. If a reading buffer is not specified, the PSU ignores the slot[Z].psu[X].measure.count attribute and only makes one measurement.  The readingBuffer is cleared before making any measurements unless the buffer is configured to append data.

For sequential commands, a command is processed fully before the next one is executed.  When this attribute is set to enable, a command returns as soon as it is able, even if it has not been reflected in the hardware. For example, the command for setting the source voltage level returns to Lua so it can process the next command, even if the instrument has not yet transitioned to the new voltage level.  Not all commands can be overlapped. If they can be, the command gets added to the processing queue of the channel and execute in order. Channels process their respective queue in parallel with other channels. If the command cannot be overlapped, the PSU inserts a waitcomplete() between commands. For example, if a print(slot[Z].psu[X].source.rangev)) command is executed after a slot[Z].psu[X].source.levelv = newLevel command, the PSU completes the level change before printing the source range as if there were a waitcomplete() command executed between them.

Note that measure commands do not wait for commands to fully complete on a different channel.  This attribute is useful when performing operations on multiple channels.

The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep. Instead, it is used to calculate source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the number of times the source.action.step block is visited is greater than the number of points in a sweep as configured, the instrument satisfies the block execution count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning.  If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, end is not reached during the sweep. This means that if the block execution count is less than the number of source values configured, the instrument satisfies the block execution count and ignores the remaining source values.  In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.  A logarithmic staircase sweep is similar to a linear staircase sweep. In a logarithmic sweep, however, the steps are scaled logarithmically.  The asymptote parameter customizes the inflection and offset of the source value curve. This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.  The asymptote value must be outside the range defined by the start and end values. It must not be equal to or between the start and end values.  To advance through the configured sweep, use source action blocks in a trigger model. Available blocks include slot[Z].trigger.model.addblock.source.action.step, .set, .skip, and .bias.
