<h4 class="heading4">Run-time and nonvolatile memory storage of scripts</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Scripts are loaded into the run-time environment of the instrument. From there, they can be stored in the nonvolatile memory.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The run-time environment is a collection of global variables, which include scripts, that the user has defined. A global variable can be used to store a value while the instrument is turned on. When you create a script, the instrument creates a global variable with the same name so that you can reference the script more conveniently. After scripts are loaded into the run-time environment, you can run and manage them from the front panel of the instrument or from a computer. Information in the run-time environment is lost when the instrument is turned off. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Nonvolatile memory is where information is stored even when the instrument is turned off. Save scripts to nonvolatile memory to save them even if the power is cycled. The scripts that are in nonvolatile memory are loaded into the run-time environment when the instrument is turned on.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Scripts are placed in the run-time environment at the following times:</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">When they are run.</li><li class="listbullet">When they are loaded over a remote command interface.</li><li class="listbullet">When the instrument is turned on (if they are stored in nonvolatile memory).</li></ul><p class="bodytext">For detail on the amount of available memory, see Memory considerations for the run-time environment.</p>
<p class="note"><img src="notehelp.png" alt="VARIABLE - NOTE" height="48" width="176" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" border="0"><br>If you make changes to a script in the run-time environment, the changes are lost when the instrument is turned off. To save the changes, you must save them to nonvolatile memory. See Working with scripts in nonvolatile memory.</p>
