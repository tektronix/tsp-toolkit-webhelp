This ADC is used for the guard measurement and internal measurements.  slot[Z].smu[X].ACAL_ADJUST_ALL  Runs all of the previous procedures sequentially.  When the specified calibration procedure is completed, the adjusted calibration constants are independently saved for each procedure, as well as the time and temperature. These constants are used to update the recommended due date for the procedure and to determine when the automatic calibration constants expire.  If a procedure fails, an error message is returned and the calibration data is not changed. If a failure occurs while running slot[Z].smu[X].ACAL_ADJUST_ALL, the data is not updated for any procedure.  Each procedure requires the user to put the SMU into a high impedance output state before running slot[Z].smu[X].acal.adjust(). This prevents the user from needing to disconnect the output leads when performing automatic calibration. An error message will be generated if the SMU is not in a high impedance state when the command runs.

For example, running slot[Z].smu[X].measure.calibratei() will reset the auto calibration data associated with slot[Z].smu[X].ACAL_I_MEASURE_OFFSET.

When SENSE_AUTO is selected, 4-wire sense also includes the autosense circuit. Autosense monitors the remote sense terminals. If they become disconnected, resistors are placed between the force and sense pairs to prevent unexpected voltages.  You can change the local or remote sense mode while the output is on.  The slot[Z].smu[X].SENSE_CALA mode is only used for calibration. You must enable calibration before selecting the calibration sense setting. The output must be off when this option is selected.  Example  slot[1].smu[1].sense = slot[1].smu[1].SENSE_REMOTE  Configures the sense mode to remote sense operation for channel 1 of the module installed in slot 1.

The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep. Instead, it is used to calculate source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the number of times the source.action.step block is visited is greater than the number of points in a sweep as configured, the instrument satisfies the block execution count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning.  If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, end is not reached during the sweep. This means that if the block execution count is less than the number of source values configured, the instrument satisfies the block execution count and ignores the remaining source values.  In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.  A logarithmic staircase sweep is similar to a linear staircase sweep. In a logarithmic sweep, however, the steps are scaled logarithmically.  The asymptote parameter customizes the inflection and offset of the source value curve. This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.  The asymptote value must be outside the range defined by the start and end values. It must not be equal to or between the start and end values.  To advance through the configured sweep, use source action blocks in a trigger model. Available blocks include slot[Z].trigger.model.addblock.source.action.step, .set, .skip, and .bias. When you use trigger model source action blocks to progress through the sweep:  If the number of source block executions exceeds the configured number of levels, the sweep wraps to the beginning.  If the number of executions is less than the configured number of levels, the remaining source values are ignored and not used.  The SMU stores the most recent configured source action. The last call to a sweep command is used for the source action in a trigger model. The sweep commands are slot[Z].smu[X].trigger.source.linearY(), slot[Z].smu[X].trigger.source.listY(), and slot[Z].smu[X].trigger.source.logY().  Example  SmuCh1 = slot[1].smu[1]  --- Set the logarithmic sweep starting at 1 V rising to 5 V over 5 steps. ---  slot[1].smu[1].trigger.source.logv(1, 5, 6)  --- Delete old trigger model instance before creating new one. ---  slot[1].trigger.model.delete(\"TM1\")  slot[1].trigger.model.create(\"TM1\")  --- Loop 6 times, stepping the voltage from 1 V to 5 V for 5 steps.
