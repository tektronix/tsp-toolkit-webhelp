To prevent this from occurring, you can turn on the breakdown protection function. This adds a 500&nbsp;Ω resistor in series with the SMU force lead. This resistor limits, at a wide bandwidth, the breakdown current to a maximum value of VOUTPUT/500.","When the breakdown protection is set for AUTO operation, the resistor is in place for the 200&nbsp;V and 1000&nbsp;V ranges and current ranges less than or equal to the 10&nbsp;mA range. Above the 10&nbsp;mA range or on lower voltage ranges, the breakdown protection resistor is automatically taken out of series with the SMU force lead.","An example of when breakdown protection is appropriate is when you are testing components to specify the DUT breakdown voltage. One method is to test the component at the specified breakdown voltage and determine if the leakage current has exceeded a threshold level. For example, if you are testing a 1000&nbsp;V rated MOSFET, you can short the gate to the source and apply 1050&nbsp;V from the drain to the source while measuring the actual drain current. Testing at 1050&nbsp;V instead of 1000&nbsp;V provides some assurance that the component both meets and exceeds the breakdown requirement by some user&#8209;specified margin. In this test, if the breakdown protection is off, you may find that at the exact moment of component breakdown, the current may exceed the limit current value.&nbsp;With the breakdown function on, the peak current is limited to VOUTPUT/500.","A more comprehensive method of testing components to specify the DUT breakdown voltage is to measure the actual component breakdown voltage. To do this on a 1000&nbsp;V rated MOSFET, you need to switch the sourcing method to current and the limit voltage to 1100&nbsp;V (higher than the highest expected breakdown voltage). Sourcing the value of the breakdown current permits the SMU to measure the actual breakdown voltage of the component, which occurs precisely when the SMU reaches the programmed source current. When this operating point is reached, a voltage measurement records the actual breakdown voltage of the component, after which the small source current used to find this breakdown voltage can be reduced to zero while waiting for the next component to test.&nbsp;The entire test should be done quickly with the lowest possible breakdown current to limit device self-heating.

Specified accuracies for instrument source and measurement capabilities are only guaranteed when you use 4&#8209;wire remote sensing.","By default, the Model 2470 instruments are configured to use 2-wire or local voltage sensing. If you choose to enable 4-wire or remote voltage sensing, it is critical that you establish and maintain the proper Kelvin connections between the corresponding force and sense leads to ensure the proper operation of the instrument and to make accurate voltage measurements. Sense HI must be connected to Force HI, and Sense LO must be connected to Force LO.","When sourcing voltage with remote sense, the instrument relies on the voltage detected with the sense lines to provide the proper closed-loop control of its output voltage. If a sense line becomes disconnected from its corresponding force line, an erroneous voltage is sensed and the output voltage may be adjusted to a level that is radically different than the programmed voltage level (possibly to hazardous levels, depending on the model).","When sourcing current with remote sense, the instrument relies on the voltage detected with the sense lines to properly limit the voltage across the device-under-test. If a sense line becomes disconnected from its corresponding force line, an erroneous voltage is sensed and the voltage across the device may exceed the programmed source limit voltage, possibly causing damage to the device or test fixture.","In both cases, the voltage is not measured correctly if a sense lead becomes disconnected from its corresponding force lead.","@Even with the overvoltage protection set to the lowest value (20&nbsp;V), never touch anything connected to the terminals of the Model 2470 when the instrument is on. Always assume that a hazardous voltage (greater than 30&nbsp;VRMS) is present when the instrument is on. To prevent damage to the device under test or external circuitry, do not set the voltage source to levels that exceed the value that is set for overvoltage protection.","To prevent unexpected voltages caused by a sense lead that becomes disconnected from its corresponding force lead during remote sense operation, you can enable overvoltage protection (OVP) to restrict the maximum output voltage level of the instrument when either voltage or current is sourced. With OVP enabled, the voltage between the Force HI and the Force LO terminals will not exceed the specified overvoltage limit value regardless of the voltage present on the sense leads. Refer to Overvoltage protection for additional information.","To make 4&#8209;wire measurements, you must set the sense mode of the instrument to 4&#8209;wire, as described in the following topics.","@<br>  When you are sourcing voltage in 4&#8209;wire remote sense, connect the sense leads to the DUT.
