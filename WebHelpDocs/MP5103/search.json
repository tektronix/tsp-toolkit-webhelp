A trigger line uses the digital I/O lines to detect triggers.  The following settings of triggerMode set the line for direct control as a digital line:  digio.MODE_DIGITAL_IN: The instrument automatically detects externally generated logic levels. You can read an input line, but you cannot write to it.  digio.MODE_DIGITAL_OUT: You can set the line as logic high (+5&nbsp;V) or as logic low (0&nbsp;V). The default level is logic low (0&nbsp;V). When the instrument is in output mode, the line is actively driven high or low.  digio.MODE_DIGITAL_OPEN_DRAIN: Configures the line to be an open&#8209;drain signal. The line can serve as an input, an output or both. When a digital I/O line is used as an input in open&#8209;drain mode, you must write a 1 to it.  The following settings of triggerMode set the line for direct control as a trigger line:  digio.MODE_TRIGGER_IN: The line automatically responds to and detects externally generated triggers. It detects falling&#8209;edge, rising&#8209;edge, or either&#8209;edge triggers as input. This line state uses the edge setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].edge attribute.  digio.MODE_TRIGGER_OUT: The line is automatically set high or low depending on the output logic specified by the digio.trigger[N].logic attribute. Use the negative logic setting when you want to generate a falling edge trigger and use the positive logic setting when you want to generate a rising edge trigger.  digio.MODE_TRIGGER_OPEN_DRAIN: Configures the line to be an open&#8209;drain signal. You can use the line to detect input triggers or generate output triggers. This line state uses the edge setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].edge attribute and the logic setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].logic attribute.  When the line is set as a synchronous acceptor, the line detects the falling-edge input triggers and automatically latches and drives the trigger line low. Asserting an output trigger releases the&nbsp;latched line.  When the line is set as a synchronous master, the line detects rising-edge triggers as input. For output, the line asserts a TTL-low pulse.  Example  digio.trigger[3].mode = digio.MODE_DIGITAL_IN  Sets the trigger mode for I/O line 3 to digio.MODE_DIGITAL_IN.

A trigger line uses the digital I/O lines to detect triggers.  The following settings of triggerMode set the line for direct control as a digital line:  tsplink.MODE_DIGITAL_IN: The instrument automatically detects externally generated logic levels. You can read an input line, but you cannot write to it.  tsplink.MODE_DIGITAL_OUT: You can set the line as logic high (+5&nbsp;V) or as logic low (0&nbsp;V). The default level is logic low (0&nbsp;V). When the instrument is in output mode, the line is actively driven high or low.  tsplink.MODE_DIGITAL_OPEN_DRAIN: Configures the line to be an open&#8209;drain signal. The line can serve as an input, an output or both. When a digital I/O line is used as an input in open&#8209;drain mode, you must write a 1 to it.  The following settings of triggerMode set the line for direct control as a trigger line:   tsplink.MODE_TRIGGER_IN: The line automatically responds to and detects externally generated triggers. It detects falling&#8209;edge, rising&#8209;edge, or either&#8209;edge triggers as input. This line state uses the edge setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].edge attribute.  tsplink.MODE_TRIGGER_OUT: The line is automatically set high or low depending on the output logic specified by the digio.trigger[N].logic attribute. Use the negative logic setting when you want to generate a falling edge trigger and use the positive logic setting when you want to generate a rising edge trigger.  tsplink.MODE_TRIGGER_OPEN_DRAIN: Configures the line to be an open&#8209;drain signal. You can use the line to detect input triggers or generate output triggers. This line state uses the edge setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].edge attribute and the logic setting specified by the digio.trigger[N].logic attribute.  When the line is set as a synchronous acceptor, the line detects the falling-edge input triggers and automatically latches and drives the trigger line low.

If the portNumber is 23, the interface uses the telnet protocol and sets appropriate termination characters to communicate with the device.  If a portNumber and initString are provided, it is assumed that the remote device is not TSP&#8209;enabled. The MP5103 does not perform any extra processing, prompt handling, error handling, or sending of commands. In addition, the tspnet.tsp.* commands cannot be used on devices that are not TSP&#8209;enabled.  If neither a portNumber nor an initString is provided, the remote device is assumed to be a Keithley TSP&#8209;enabled device. Depending on the state of the tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect attribute, the MP5103 sends an abort command to the remote device on connection.   The instrument also enables TSP prompts on the remote device and event management. The instrument places remote errors and events from the TSP&#8209;enabled device in its own event queue and prefaces these events with Remote Error, followed by an event description.   Do not manually change either the prompt functionality (localnode.prompts) or show errors by changing localnode.showerrors on the remote TSP-enabled device. If you do this, subsequent tspnet.tsp.* commands using the connection may fail.  When you are connecting to a host or IP address, you can add a layer of transport layer security (TLS). When security is enabled, the instrument negotiates the security protocol when connecting to the host or IP address. This security protocol is used when using tspnet.write() to send data or tspnet.read() to receive data. Typically, the port is 443 if TLS is enabled.  You can simultaneously connect to a maximum of 32 remote devices.

The MP5103 decodes the response message according to the format specified in the format string and returns the message as return values from the function (see tspnet.read() for format specifiers).  When this command is sent to a TSP-enabled instrument, the MP5103 suspends operation until a timeout error is generated or until the instrument responds.
