Page[554]=new Array("LAN triggering is similar to hardware synchronization except that LXI trigger packets are used instead of hardware signals. A bit in the LXI trigger packet called the hardware value simulates the state of a hardware trigger line. The 2601B-PULSE stores the hardware value of the last LXI trigger packet that was sent or received as the pseudo line state.","The stateless event flag is a bit in the LXI trigger packet that indicates if the hardware value should be ignored. If it is set, the 2601B-PULSE ignores the hardware value of the packet and generates a trigger event. The 2601B-PULSE always sets the stateless flag for outgoing LXI trigger packets. If the stateless event flag is not set, the hardware value indicates the state of the signal.","Changes in the hardware value of consecutive LXI trigger packets are interpreted as edge transitions. Edge transitions generate trigger events. If the hardware value does not change between successive LXI trigger packets, the 2601B-PULSE assumes an edge transition was missed and generates a trigger event. The following table illustrates edge detection in LAN triggering.","LXI trigger edge detection","Stateless event flag","Hardware value","Pseudo line state","Falling edge","Rising edge","0","0","0","Detected","Detected","0","1","0","-","Detected","0","0","1","Detected","-","0","1","1","Detected","Detected","1","-","-","Detected","Detected","Set the LAN trigger mode to configure the edge detection method in incoming LXI trigger packets.

You must assign group numbers to each node using remote commands. If you do not assign a node to a group, it defaults to group 0, which will always be grouped with the master node (regardless of the group to which the master node is assigned).","Using groups to manage nodes on TSP-Link network","3240.htm");

","Use the data queue commands to:","Share data between test scripts running in parallel","Access data from a remote group or a local node on a TSP&#8209;Link® network at any time","You cannot access the reading buffers or global variables from any node in a remote group while a node in that group is performing an overlapped operation. However, you can use the data queue to retrieve data from any node in a group that is performing an overlapped operation. In addition, the master node and the group leaders can use the data queue to coordinate activities.","Tables in the data queue consume one entry. When a node stores a table in the data queue, a copy of the data in the table is made. When the data is retrieved from the data queue, a new table is created on the node that is retrieving the data. The new table contains a separate copy of the data in the original table, with no references to the original table or any subtables.","You can access data from the data queue even if a remote group or a node has overlapped operations in process.
