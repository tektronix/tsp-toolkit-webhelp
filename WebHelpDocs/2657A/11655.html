<h3 class="heading3">Remote reading buffer programming</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Readings can be obtained by taking overlapped or non-overlapped measurements. Routines that make single&#8209;point measurements can be configured to make multiple measurements where one would ordinarily be made. The measured value is not the only component of a reading. The measurement status (for example, &#8220;In Compliance&#8221; or &#8220;Overranged&#8221;) is also an element of data associated with a particular reading.</p>
<p class="bodytext">All routines that return measurements can also store the measurements in the reading buffers. Overlapped measurements always return readings in a reading buffer. Non-overlapped measurement functions can return single-point measurement values or store multiple values in a reading buffer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A reading buffer is based on a Lua table. The measurements are accessed by ordinary array accesses. If <code class="monospace">rb</code> is a reading buffer, the first measurement is accessed as <code class="monospace">rb[1]</code> and the 9th measurement as <code class="monospace">rb[9]</code>, and so on. The additional information in the table is accessed as additional members of the table.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The load, save, and write operations for reading buffers function differently in the remote state. From a remote command interface, you can extract data from reading buffers as the instrument acquires the data.</p>
